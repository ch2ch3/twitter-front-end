Twitter Front End
=================
This week's challenge was to reimplement the Twitter.com feed page as close as possible to the real look and feel, so as to improve our front-end skills.

Main features:

- a fixed-position header which stays in place as the page is scrolled
- infinite scrolling with dummy data using JavaScript
- tweet input box which expands on focus to show more options
- a pop-up modal for adding a new tweet through the button in the header
- making the window width smaller changes the layout of the page

Technologies used:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- [Kyle Fox's jQuery modal](https://github.com/kylefox/jquery-modal)
